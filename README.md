# JobListings

## Project Description
This application showcases a comprehensive list of jobs, enabling effortless browsing and refining through various criteria such as job type, company name, location, and description. Additionally, it facilitates sorting options based on date, location, and description for user convenience.

#### Technologies used: Angular, NGRX(for state management), RXJS Typescript, SCSS and Bootstrap

## Challenges faced:
- I intended to utilize Google Cloud for storage, yet the latest Angular Fire package unfortunately isn't compatible with Angular 17.

## How to run the project
Step 1 : Run npm install (Ensure you have deleted the node modules and package-lock.json)

```
Run: npm install
```

Step 2: Serve the application 

```
Run: ng serve
```

Step 4: Simulate the restful API. 

```
Run: npm run json-run

```

##### Note: If you need to change the data displayed on view, you can edit the db.json file
